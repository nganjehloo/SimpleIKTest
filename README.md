To run the program all that needs to be done is to follow the instructors project setup guide, and replace the included IKTest.cpp with my IKTest.cpp. I built the program
as a debug application in case that makes a difference. I also included a copy of the executable just incase. Just incase I have also included my entire project directory for this assignment as well.

The speed of the IK animating towards the click point is framerate dependent. I made the step size sufficiently small so that you can see the animation on my machine, but
depending the speed of your machine it may run faster or slower.
